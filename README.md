Folder Structure + Homepage Prompt

“Generate a simple React front-end folder structure for a taxi booking app called Book_A_Taxi with pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, Book). Include a Navbar with links using react-router-dom and basic CSS. Keep code beginner-friendly.”

Additional Pages Prompt

“Produce tiny React components for About, Services, and Contact pages with simple text content and semantic HTML.”

Navigation Prompt

“Create a <NavBar> component using NavLink so the active page has a highlighted style. Use a minimal CSS class.”

Booking Page Prompt

“Generate a <Book> page containing a basic booking form (name, email, phone, pickup, dropoff, date, time, service type, passengers, notes). Keep the JSX very simple.”

Validation Prompt

“Add simple client-side validation in the booking form: required fields, email pattern, 10-digit phone, passengers ≥ 1, date not in the past. Show errors under each field. Use plain React state, no libraries.”

Reflection Prompt // by me

I used ChatGPT to create this website. It was scary easy and fast to do and i did not have to explain much. I did the initial folder structure using my terminal "npm vite@latest -- template react" then i installed react-router-dom because react-router wasnt working since chatGPT wanted to use -dom. I asked the chat to keep the styling and code simple and readable while incorporating what the rubric required. The final code provided resulted in a working taxi app that has a simple look.
